          <div> As you can see, each one is different, but each one gives the member a place to land. The other thing you might have noticed is that they don't have to be located specifically at the My Account page. You can put a customer dashboard anywhere you want. There's nothing special with that specific name !</div>
          <div>Each of these items becomes a tab in the customer dashboard, as you'll see below. It also allows you to add icons for each item. You'll see I added a Subscription tab that would allow me to route people to their billing subscription if I was doing it externally</div>
          <div>This single plugin does everything you want â€“ from creating links to other pages on your site (or other sites), to creating endpoints where you can host forms and other content on your pages</div>
